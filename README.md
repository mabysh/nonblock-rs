# nonblock-rs
This library provides wrapper around file descriptors (e.g. stdin, sockets, streams, child stdout, named pipes) to read available data without blocking, as well as [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)-compatible stream.

This is fork of [original crate](https://github.com/anowell/nonblock-rs)
